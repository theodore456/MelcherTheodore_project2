In this code, the program will first ask you to input a letter
then the code will check to see if it matches the correct word or not
then the game ends once you reach 10 tries or guess the word correctly 
but unfortunately the word will be encrypted
Thankfully, there is also a decrypt function! This function decrypts the encrypted word by
subtracting 1 to the ASCII values of the even ASCII values of the encrypted word and doing the
opposite to the odd values
